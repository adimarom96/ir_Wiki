The code orgenized so there is frontend file that have the flask and the run command. 
Also in this file is all the search functions that was given to us, but in every one of them we call to a different search function from the proccess instance.
The second file is the backend that contains the proccess class. In this file we also have the Inverted Index class.
While the system goes up, we call for each index from the bucket and load it. 
Addinioanly we create the process instance that will hold them and will search with his search functions.
We have some search functions.
  1. anchor search - 
  2. title search  - 
  3. body search   - 
  4. search        - combined search in all the indcies we have. after several tests we decided to give the weight of: X Y Z W
